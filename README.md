vp64
====

Virtual Processor 64 (VP64) is an emulator or virtual machine with the same instruction set as the eP64 (Embedded Processor 64-bit) powering the Kestrel-3.  VP64 is expected to be quite useful in writing and validating software for the Kestrel-3 without requiring a complete set of physical hardware resources.
